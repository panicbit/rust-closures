# Closures

This crate provides an abstraction for seperating code and state.
Among other things it allows for **recursive closures** and
for trait implementations like `PartialEq` and `Clone`.

See the [examples directory](https://github.com/panicbit/rust-closures/tree/master/examples) for some usage examples.

A nightly version of Rust is required because this crate relies on
[unboxed closures](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18101).
